Customer Churn Analysis using Python

📖 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecom company using Python. The primary goal is to explore and understand the factors that lead to customer attrition and provide data-driven insights to improve customer retention strategies.

📌 Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based businesses. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By analyzing churn patterns, companies can identify at-risk customers and take preventive actions.

🧪 Dataset
The dataset includes information on telecom customers such as demographic details, account information, service usage, contract types, and whether or not the customer has churned.

Key features:
Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents
Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
Contract type, Payment method, Internet service, etc.
Churn (Yes/No)

🔍 Objectives
Clean and preprocess the dataset
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Identify key factors that influence churn
Visualize important trends and relationships
Provide insights to support business decisions

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebook for code execution and documentation

📊 Key Highlights
Handled missing and inconsistent data, and encoded categorical variables
Conducted EDA to identify churn distribution and relationships with other variables
Found an overall churn rate of approximately 26%
Identified high churn segments: senior citizens, customers with month-to-month contracts, and those with fiber optic internet
Created visual insights into tenure, internet service, contract type, and payment methods

📈 Key Insights
Senior citizens and short-tenure customers are more likely to churn
Customers on month-to-month contracts showed significantly higher churn
Higher churn observed among customers with fiber optic internet and electronic check payments
Long-term contracts and auto-pay methods correlated with reduced churn

💡 Conclusion
This analysis helps uncover actionable insights that telecom companies can use to build targeted retention strategies. For example, offering incentives to month-to-month customers or improving services for senior citizens could help reduce churn rates.
